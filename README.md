# Flow.js

Flow.js is a JavaScript library that aims to abstract the complex, lengthy and verbose process of rendering WebGL onto our web browsers. It is specifically designed to help developers and 3D artists from around the world to manage 3D assets in a web based system more easily and systematically.

## Why Flow.js?

WebGL and Three.js are powerfulâ€”but verbose, low-level, and intimidating to newcomers. Flow.js removes the boilerplate, letting you focus on your **scene**, not the scaffolding.

Use simple config-based or declarative patterns to:
- Set up 3D scenes
- Load models
- Add lights, cameras, and interactions
- Animate objects
- Compose complex scenes from reusable components
